The Animal Shelter Data program demonstrates the use of different programs and frameworks working together to create a finished full stack application. Ensuring that each of these programs have been written in a maintainable, readable, and adaptable way is essential. The fact that the application is pieced into several smaller programs allows each piece to be maintained separately. This is important when considering future changes that may need to be made. If the client wants a different UI design (such as moving from a web app to a mobile app), the UI framework can be changed without needing to change anything within the middleware or the database itself. Taking the time to lookup and follow industry standards in coding, as well as appropriately commenting throughout, assures that programs are readable. The middleware application, which uses python to perform CRUD operations on the database, is important to keep the application adaptable. Many times clients will need to perform these same operations on different databases than the Animal Shelter database, so using a middleware application such as the animal_shelter.py program can make code reuse easy from application to application.
